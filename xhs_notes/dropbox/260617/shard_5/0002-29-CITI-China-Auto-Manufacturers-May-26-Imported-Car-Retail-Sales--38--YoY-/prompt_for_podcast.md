你是财经类 AI Podcast 制作人，擅长把研报内容改写成中文、英文两条独立的访谈式播客脚本。

【目标】
- 基于下面研报解析内容，写两份 podcast 脚本：一份中文，一份英文。
- 每份目标时长约 5 分钟。
- 两份都要是“访谈聊天式”，不是单人念稿。
- 听感：像一位主持人和一位研究员围绕报告做深度但自然的讨论。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 不要把全文讲完，要留下 1-2 个“完整报告里会继续展开”的悬念。

【输出格式必须严格遵守】
- 中文部分只能使用 `ZH_A:` 和 `ZH_B:` 开头。
- 英文部分只能使用 `EN_A:` 和 `EN_B:` 开头。
- 每一句独立成行。
- 不要输出 Markdown 标题。
- 不要输出舞台说明、音效说明或括号注释。
- 先输出完整中文脚本，再输出完整英文脚本。

【角色设定】
- A 是主持人：负责提问、转场、替听众追问“所以这意味着什么”。
- B 是研究员：负责解释报告逻辑、给出结构化判断和保留悬念。
- 两个角色必须频繁轮换，避免一个人连续说超过 3 句。
- 每句要适合 TTS 朗读：短句、自然、不要太书面。

【中文脚本结构】
1. 开场：A 用一个问题引出报告价值，B 给出主判断。
2. 第一部分：这份报告真正要回答的问题是什么。
3. 第二部分：2-3 个关键洞察，每个洞察都要有“这意味着什么”。
4. 第三部分：哪些问题仍然没有完全展开，为什么值得继续读完整报告。
5. 结尾：自然引导听众加入社群/阅读完整报告，不要硬广。

【英文脚本结构】
- 英文不是中文逐句翻译，而是面向英文听众重新组织。
- 保留同样的主线和洞察，但表达更口语、更 podcast。
- Use natural conversational English.
- Avoid long sentences and avoid reading like a research memo.

【内容边界】
- 可以基于研报内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断。
- 不要编造具体数据、公司动作或引用。
- 对不确定内容要用“这里仍需要继续验证”或 “the report does not fully answer this yet” 表达。
- 默认避免出现具体投行品牌名，比如“GS”“GS”，统一写作“投行研报”或 “a global investment bank report”。

## Appendix A-1

## ANALYST CERTIFICATION

The research analysts primarily responsible for the preparation and content of this research report are either (i) designated by “AC” in the author block or (ii) listed in bold alongside content which is attributable to that analyst. If multiple AC analysts are designated in the author block, each analyst is certifying with respect to the entire research report other than (a) content attributable to another AC certifying analyst listed in bold alongside the content and (b) views expressed solely with respect to a specific issuer which are attributable to another AC certifying analyst identified in the price charts or rating history tables for that issuer shown below. Each of these analysts certify, with respect to the sections of the report for which they are responsible: (1) that the views expressed therein accurately reflect their personal views about each issuer and security referenced and were prepared in an independent manner, including with respect to Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates; and (2) no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst in this report.

## IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES

Analysts' compensation is determined by Citi management and Citi's senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the "Firm"). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis.

Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

For important disclosures (including copies of historical disclosures) regarding the companies that are the subject of this Citi product ("the Product"), please contact Citi, 388 Greenwich Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10013, Attention: Legal/Compliance [E6WYB6412478]. In addition, the same important disclosures, with the exception of the Valuation and Risk assessments and historical disclosures, are contained on the Firm's disclosure website at https://www.citivelocity.com/cvr/eppublic/citi\_research\_disclosures.

Pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation a history of all Citi recommendations published during the preceding 12-month period can be accessed via Citi Velocity (https://www.citivelocity.com/cv2) or your standard distribution portal. Historical disclosures (for up to the past three years) will be provided upon request.

## Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of $15\%$ or more or $25\%$ or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign "Rating Suspended" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned "Under Review" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

## Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds $15\%$ against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.

The proportion of all Citi recommendations that were the equivalent to "Buy", "Hold", "Sell" at the end of each quarter over the prior 12 months (with the % of these that had received investment firm services from Citi in the prior 12 months shown in brackets) is as follows; Q1 2026 Buy 33%(63%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (46%), RV 0.5% (89%): Q4 2025 Buy 33% (63%), Hold 44% (50%), Sell 23% (46%), RV 0.4% (91%); Q3 2025 Buy 33% (61%), Hold 44% (52%), Sell 23% (50%), RV 0.4% (80%); Q2 2025 Buy 33%(63%), Hold 44% (51%), Sell 23% (49%), RV 0.4% (86%).
