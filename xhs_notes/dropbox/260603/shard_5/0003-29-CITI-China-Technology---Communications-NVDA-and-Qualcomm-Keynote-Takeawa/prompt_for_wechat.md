你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断，例如“市场真正低估的不是需求，而是供给侧的再定价”。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：一句主判断，不超过 32 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
5. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
6. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。
7. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
8. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。可以类似“欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论”。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 默认避免出现具体投行品牌名，比如“GS”“GS”，统一写作“投行研报”。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

NVDA and Qualcomm Keynote Takeaways

## CITI'S TAKE

NVDA CEO Jensen Huang delivered a GTC keynote today where he noted: (1) Vera Rubin has reached full commercial production, seemingly confirming the 2H26 ramp for the NVDA supply chain (FII, VGT, WUS). (2) NVDA has evolved from being a GPU-focused system company into a full-stack AI infrastructure company, which may extend its partnerships to power/cooling supply chains including Chinese players. (3) With the introduction of the Vera CPU specifically for the "Agentic AI" era and reinforcement learning, we see positive implications for Lenovo, which is also one of ecosystem partners set to benefit from the new GPU server platform and Nvidia Windows-based laptops with higher ASPs. We also watch for the long-term potential demand impact to Montage's memory interface chips given Nvidia's shift toward SOCAMM/LPDDR5. (4) Qualcomm's new data center portfolio Dragonfly may provide an additional source to China ASIC datacenter solutions.

Key highlights from Nvidia GTC keynote — (1) Software should be presented as an agent; tokens are for revenue/profit generation. We see many Chinese software/ICT companies migrating to agent's provider and token-based business model. (2) Vera Rubin has reached full commercial production, which likely confirms the 2H26 ramp for the NVDA supply chain (FII, VGT, WUS); TFC was highlighted twice in the video presentation. (3) Nvidia is now a full-stack AI infrastructure company and implied it would expand its supply chain control beyond L10 to include L11 (rack) and L12 (cluster). (4) All about CPU—Nvidia sees Vera CPU as the next growth driver not only for its data center business but also edge devices with the launch of the RTX Spark laptop and new lines of PCs. (5) Agentic AI and Physical AI—The company highlighted autonomous driving and industrial and humanoid robotics.

Key highlights from Qualcomm Computex keynote — (1) Qualcomm launched Dragonfly, its new product brand dedicated to data center environments. (2) Snapdragon platforms are evolving into native execution layers for third-party AI agents. (3) Qualcomm is extending edge silicon into high-growth mobility and industrial automation frameworks like vehicles, robotics, and 6G wireless.

Implications — Vera Rubin has reached full commercial production, which should be positive to the NVDA supply chain, i.e., FII, VGT, WUS on 2H26 ramp. We also see positive implications to Lenovo, which is also an ecosystem partner set to benefit from the new GPU server platform and the Nvidia Windows-based laptop with higher ASP contribution. That said, we watch for the long-term potential demand impact to Montage's memory interface chips given that Nvidia's Vera CPU and Spark platform adopt the SOCAMM/LPDDR5X memory architecture instead of RDIMM and hence could erode DIMM chip opportunities should Nvidia CPU claim a larger share of server processors. We believe Qualcomm's new datacenter portfolio Dragonfly could provide an additional source to China ASIC datacenter solutions. NVIDIA's and Qualcomm's keynotes both signal that the industry has transitioned from the foundational LLM paradigm—characterized by static prompt-and-response interactions—into the agentic AI and physical AI era, suggesting a potentially faster-than-expected pace of AI edge proliferation in China.

## Key takeaways from Nvidia and Qualcomm keynote speeches

From standalone GPU acceleration toward engineering of integrated and pod-scale systems — Nvidia emphasized that it is a full-stack AI infrastructure company. The centerpiece of its next-generation AI infrastructure is the Vera Rubin platform, a multi-rack supercomputing system that has reached full commercial production. Built on an advanced 3nm process, the platform integrates seven specialized chips. The system utilizes next-generation HBM4 memory architectures to overcome memory bandwidth bottlenecks. Large scale-out and scale-up capabilities are driven by the unified integration of NVLink 72, CX9 SuperNICs, and Bluefield-4 DPUs. To sustain operational power requirements exceeding 5,000 amps, the Rubin architecture implements advanced 45°C liquid cooling loops. It also features a cable-less midplane design, removing physical connectivity failure points and increasing systemic resiliency. The Nvidia Vera Rubin DSX AI Factory reference design outlines how to design, build, and operate the entire AI factory infrastructure stack including NVL rack, Vera GPU rack, spectrum-6 SPX switch, Groq 3 LPX rack, and Vera BlueField-4 STX storage rack.

NVDA's first host processor Vera CPU designed specifically for autonomous AI workloads — Built on the Olympus Core, the Vera CPU achieves the industry's highest instructions per clock (IPC), capable of decoding 10 instructions per cycle. It is the first enterprise CPU to adopt LPDDR5 memory to deliver an ultra-wide 1.2TB/s of memory bandwidth. The chip features an 88-core monolithic mesh topology. By avoiding a modular chiplet architecture, it eliminates inter-die communication delays. Real-world architectural benchmarks indicate that the Vera CPU runs 3x faster in complex SQL database tasks and 6x faster in real-time data stream processing compared to x86 counterparts, removing the primary bottlenecks in agentic tool-calling pipelines.

RTX Spark platform to bring agentic capabilities directly to local workstations and laptops — NVIDIA, in collaboration with Microsoft, introduced the RTX Spark platform. These Windows-compatible, CUDA-enabled machines feature the N1X chip (co-developed with MediaTek), combining a Blackwell-architecture RTX GPU containing over 6,000 cores with a 20-core Grace CPU. Delivering 1 petaflop of localized AI compute performance and 128GB of unified memory, this platform enables complex, multi-modal autonomous agents to execute natively on end-user devices without relying on constant cloud connectivity.

Qualcomm Dragonfly for Data Center Portfolio Expansion — To establish a continuous computing pipeline from consumer devices to backend infrastructure, Qualcomm launched Dragonfly, its new product brand dedicated to data center environments. This portfolio expansion allows Qualcomm to offer a seamless compute continuum, matching high-performance cloud processing with low-power edge devices under a unified architecture. More detail will be unveiled on 24 June.

Snapdragon platforms evolving into native execution layers for third-party AI agents — AI orchestration frameworks like Open Claw and Hermes run directly on Snapdragon silicon, while applications like Claude Desktop operate natively on Snapdragon-powered PCs. Google is embedding Gemini Intelligence natively into the Android stack on Snapdragon hardware, mirrored by Microsoft's integration of core agentic features into Windows on Snapdragon. Simultaneously, hardware partners like Humain are deploying complete generative operating systems built from the ground up for Snapdragon architectures.

Qualcomm extending edge silicon into high-growth mobility and industrial automation frameworks – (1) AI-Defined Vehicles—The automotive platform separates vehicular intelligence into two distinct layers: an adaptive, personalized agent inside the digital cockpit, and a dedicated physical AI system processing radar and camera inputs for real-time autonomous path planning. (2) Robotics Platforms—A comprehensive computing platform tailored for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), industrial arms, humanoids, and drones. It features a hierarchical compute model that segregates low-latency operations (e.g., balancing and grip adjustments) from high-level reasoning and action grounding. (3) 6G Wireless as an AI Catalyst—Qualcomm views upcoming 6G standards as a network

architecture built fundamentally for AI. The framework relies on high-definition video uplinks for wearable devices, distributed computing nodes embedded directly into cellular infrastructure, and RF signal processing used as physical AI input to construct real-time digital twins of physical environments.

## Appendix A-1

## ANALYST CERTIFICATION

The research analysts primarily responsible for the preparation and content of this research report are either (i) designated by “AC” in the author block or (ii) listed in bold alongside content which is attributable to that analyst. If multiple AC analysts are designated in the author block, each analyst is certifying with respect to the entire research report other than (a) content attributable to another AC certifying analyst listed in bold alongside the content and (b) views expressed solely with respect to a specific issuer which are attributable to another AC certifying analyst identified in the price charts or rating history tables for that issuer shown below. Each of these analysts certify, with respect to the sections of the report for which they are responsible: (1) that the views expressed therein accurately reflect their personal views about each issuer and security referenced and were prepared in an independent manner, including with respect to Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates; and (2) no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst in this report.

## IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES

Analysts' compensation is determined by Citi management and Citi's senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the “Firm”). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis.

Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

## Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

## Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
