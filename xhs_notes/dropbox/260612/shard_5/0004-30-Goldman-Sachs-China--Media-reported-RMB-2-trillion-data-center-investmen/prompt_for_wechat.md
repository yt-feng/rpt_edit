你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断，例如“市场真正低估的不是需求，而是供给侧的再定价”。
- `# 标题` 必须包含报告机构的中文名称。已识别机构名：`GS`。标题格式建议：`# GS：一句主判断`。如果识别机构名为空，请从研报标题/正文中识别机构并使用中文名，例如GS、摩根斯坦利、HSBC、JPM、UBS、Citi、美国银行、BARC、DB、NOM。
- 机构名只要求出现在 `# 标题` 中，正文可以克制提及，不要为了重复机构名牺牲可读性。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：机构中文名 + 一句主判断，不超过 40 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
5. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
6. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。
7. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
8. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。可以类似“欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论”。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 不要隐藏报告机构名；标题必须出现机构中文名。正文如需概括来源，可写“这份GS研报”或“该机构报告”，但不要编造机构观点以外的信息。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

# China: Media reported RMB 2 trillion data center investment not new news

## Bottom line:

A recent Bloomberg article on the Chinese government's plan to spend RMB 2 trillion on data center building has attracted market attention. However, this is not new news and was part of the “Six Networks” laid out in the 15th Five-Year Plan in March. Recent policy signals suggest implementation of China’s broader “Six Networks” — water networks, new-type power grids, computing power networks (including data centers), next-generation communication networks, urban underground pipeline networks, and logistics networks — investment push may be accelerating, supported by a wider funding mix that includes central and local government bonds, the policy bank new financing tool, and commercial bank lending. In our view, this points to a further shift in government-led investment toward high-tech manufacturing, AI infrastructure, strategic supply chains, and people’s livelihoods. Separately, we note that recent increases in policy communication and project preparation suggest policymakers may be laying the groundwork for faster deployment in H2 after the Q2 slowdown in fiscal spending. We continue to expect China’s augmented fiscal deficit (AFD) to widen after narrowing in Q2.

## Main points:

1. What happened? A 9 June Bloomberg article reported that “China is preparing to spend around 2 trillion yuan (\$295 billion) over the next five years on building data centers across the country”, drawing market attention to AI-related high-tech investment. The report said SOEs such as China Mobile and China Telecom will operate most of the facilities, while domestic suppliers including Huawei are expected to provide at least 80% of key technologies, such as AI chips. On 26 May, the Head of National Energy Administration, Wang Hongzhi, projected that annual electricity consumption by China’s data centers will rise to 800TWh in 2030 from 170TWh in 2025, implying 36% annualized growth over 2026-30 and an increase in the share of total power consumption to 6% from 1.6%. On 9 June, the state-run CCTV re-emphasized policymakers’ commitment to strengthening the “Six Networks” (“六张网”) — water networks, new-type power grids, computing power networks (including data centers), next-generation communication networks, urban underground pipeline networks, and logistics networks — echoing the April Politburo meeting. Reputable onshore media, including the 21st Century Business Herald, flagged in early June that some local governments have accelerated implementation of the policy bank new financing tool in recent months to support investment in strategically important areas such as high-tech manufacturing, AI, green transition, urban renewal, and services consumption.

2. How significant? Based on our estimates, the reported RMB2tn of data center

investment would account for only 0.8% of fixed asset investment (FAI) over 2026-30. More broadly, at the March “Two Sessions”, NDRC Head Zheng Shanjie expected that China’s investment in the “Six Networks” could exceed RMB7tn this year — equivalent to about 14% of FAI by our estimates — and that the economic scale of AI-related industries could surpass RMB10tn by 2030, although the definition of those industries remains unclear. Incorporating recent policy communications, we believe the funding for the “Six Networks” in general, and data centers in particular, will come from ultra-long-term central government special bonds (i.e., those earmarked for the “Two Majors” investment projects), local government special bonds, policy bank new financing tool, and commercial bank lending. In our view, this funding structure is intended to crowd in private capital while avoiding the high-risk, off-balance-sheet LGFV borrowing seen in previous cycles.

3. Why now? Under China's current reactive (rather than pre-emptive) policy approach, the timing and scale of easing remain data-dependent. After the stronger-than-expected Q1 GDP data, the pace of government bond issuance and spending slowed markedly in Q2, our proprietary augmented fiscal deficit (AFD) measure narrowed, and investment momentum weakened — all of which, in our view, reflected a deliberate policy choice. Without a meaningful policy offset, the ongoing global energy supply shock has also weighed on sequential growth in Q2. That said, the RMB7.7tn of unspent government bond quota as of end-May (out of RMB11.9tn for the full year), the RMB800bn policy bank new financing tool available this year (up from RMB500bn last year), and the RMB700bn year-on-year increase in outstanding fiscal deposits all suggest ample funding capacity in coming quarters. Recent developments suggest policymakers have become more cautious about the growth slowdown and are stepping up efforts to prepare investment pipelines for deployment.

4. What's the macro implication? The reported RMB2tn plan for data center investment is not new, as authorities have made similar projections before, including in January 2025 by the National Data Administration and in April 2026 by CCTV. While there has been no additional funding arrangement beyond this year's budget, recent developments suggest implementation could accelerate in coming months and reinforce our view that China's AFD may widen in H2 after narrowing in Q2 (Exhibit 1). The continued shift in government-led investment toward high-tech manufacturing, AI infrastructure, strategic supply chains, and people's livelihoods underscores policymakers' growing emphasis on high-quality growth and tech self-reliance, in line with guidance from the 4th Plenum and the 15th Five-Year Plan (for 2026-30). We see July as an important window for potential policy fine-tuning: if growth continues to soften and Q2 GDP disappoints meaningfully, there is a decent chance for policymakers to step up their easing rhetoric in the July Politburo meeting and draw on remaining fiscal buffers quickly to stabilize investment and growth, in our view (Exhibit 2).
