# Currency Risk Management: From Theory to Practice

We recently highlighted growing interest among financial institutions in a more integrated framework for managing risk, return and liquidity at the total-fund level. The challenge, often described as the total portfolio approach (TPA), is no longer whether TPA makes sense in theory, but how institutions can implement it within their own governance structures, risk systems and organisational set-up.

Holistic currency risk management, a key pillar of this approach, is becoming a more central part of the discussion. We recently published Dynamic FX Portfolio Hedging: A deep dive and why you should use it and why and how to use a currency signal on applying this principle to FX risk management. Since the papers were published last month, we have discussed these ideas with more than 35 clients. Here, we summarise the main findings from our TPA study and recent client conversations on implementing TPA in FX:

\- Currency risk is often overlooked or managed in silos: Although this has long been the norm, we are now seeing more interest in managing currency risk more actively. Choosing not to hedge is itself a risk decision and, if made passively, can affect portfolio outcomes. Across asset classes, bond exposures are typically hedged more than equities, but clients responded positively to the idea of managing FX exposures centrally. Regionally, the upcoming Dutch pension reforms are also prompting funds to take a more active approach to FX risk.

\- Defining the key objectives for currency risk management: While a very fundamental yet debated question was should one manage currency risk to add returns to the fund or asses it from the risk management angle. FX is itself an asset class and can generate returns in certain circumstances. Our approach has been to build currency hedging programmes that aim to manage the stability or risk of the portfolio while trying to preserve the portfolio returns. There was consensus on looking for returns from core assets while looking to FX for operational efficiency.

\- FX risk and benchmark-aware funds: An important theme in our conversations was how to manage currency risk without straying too far from benchmark performance. Many funds are measured against market indices that are unhedged—for example, equity portfolios often track the MSCI World. Another common reference point is peer performance. These practical constraints can be incorporated into our framework and may still allow for efficiency gains over standard approaches.

\- Hedging instruments such as forwards and options: While forwards remain the main tool for managing currency risk, options are becoming more widely used. Their embedded cost efficiencies have made them

increasingly attractive as a secondary instrument. Funds that must maintain a fully hedged currency exposure are also using options to introduce more flexibility and improve efficiency.

\- A deep dive into currency exposure beyond direct holdings: Another important theme was the need for a more holistic view of currency exposure by looking beyond portfolio holdings to underlying economic exposure. For example, if a fund owns a US stock whose business is materially exposed to the Japanese yen, the fund may also have indirect yen exposure. While there is no simple way to measure this, one possible approach discussed was to review company annual and quarterly reports to estimate those exposures.

\- Managing currency risk in private markets: Currency management is more difficult in private markets because the timing and size of cash flows are uncertain. One emerging approach is to model expected private-asset distributions under different scenarios, using long-term currency volatilities and correlations, and then design hedging strategies that balance risk reduction against the carry cost of forwards and options.

\- Cashflow management: A key practical issue in hedging is managing margin calls, especially when the hedge moves against you. For example, if a currency you are hedging against starts to strengthen, the hedged position can experience large swings. While our framework helps answer whether and how much to hedge, it also shows that hedging 100% with forwards is often inefficient because FX exposures change over time. Business solutions are available to help clients manage the resulting liquidity needs.

Quick win: Centralised FX can improve risk control without requiring a full portfolio reorganisation.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates - these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may - by construction - lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited - up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the 'Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document. If you are unable to access the website, please contact your DB representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency.

Backtested, hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record based on trading actual client portfolios, simulated results are achieved by means of the retroactive application of a backtested model itself designed with the benefit of hindsight. Taking into account historical events the backtesting of performance also differs from actual account performance because an actual investment strategy may be adjusted any time, for any reason, including a response to material, economic or market factors. The backtested performance includes hypothetical results that do not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings or the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. No representation is made that any trading strategy or account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions might produce significantly different results and prove to be more appropriate. Past hypothetical backtest results are neither an indicator nor guarantee of future returns. Actual results will vary, perhaps materially, from the analysis.

The method for computing individual E,S,G and composite ESG scores set forth herein is a novel method developed by the Research department within DB AG, computed using a systematic approach without human intervention. Different data providers, market sectors and geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. As such, the ESG scores referred to herein may differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other ESG data providers in the market and may also differ from equivalent ratings developed and implemented by other divisions within the DB Group. Such ESG scores also differ from other ratings and rankings that have historically been applied in research reports published by DB AG. Further, such ESG scores do not represent a formal or official view of DB AG.

It should be noted that the decision to incorporate ESG factors into any investment strategy may inhibit the ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with your investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of sustainable investments may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not considered, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.
