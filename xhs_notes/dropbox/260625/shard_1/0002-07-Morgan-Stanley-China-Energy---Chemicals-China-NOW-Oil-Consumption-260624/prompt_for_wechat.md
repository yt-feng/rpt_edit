你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须短、锐利、可转发，优先 18-30 个中文字符，最长不超过 36 个中文字符。
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断或悬念，例如“黄金缺的不是央行，是ETF”。
- `# 标题` 必须包含一个传播钩子，但只能用报告中真实出现或可由报告标题明确推出的信息：
  1. 机构 big name：GS、MS、JPM、UBS、Citi、美联储等。
  2. 中国读者熟悉的人名 big name：洪灏、邢自强、辜朝明；国际公众人物：特朗普、马斯克、鲍威尔等。
  3. 反常识或意外差：例如市场普遍悲观时，报告给出“触底”“修复”“再加速”等相反信号。
- 已识别机构名：`摩根斯坦利`。如果识别机构名为空，请从研报标题/正文中识别机构并使用中文名，例如GS、MS、HSBC、JPM、UBS、Citi、美国银行、BARC、DB、NOM。
- 标题里不要同时写中文机构名和英文缩写，禁止“JPM：JPM：……”“GS：GS：……”这类重复；写“JPM：……”或“GS：……”即可。
- 标题可以用问句或对比句，但不要标题党到超出原报告证据。避免“震惊”“爆了”“彻底反转”“一夜变天”等廉价词。
- 标题不要晦涩抽象。少用“结构性分化”“二阶影响”“再定价框架”这类泛化词；如果必须使用，要落到一个具体对象。
- 机构名只要求出现在 `# 标题` 中，正文可以克制提及，不要为了重复机构名牺牲可读性。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：机构中文名或报告中的 big name + 一句主判断，不超过 36 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 在正文中穿插 2-4 个 `> **KC评论：** ...` 引用块，每个 1-3 句，用更平白的话解释“这张图/这个判断对读者意味着什么”，并自然引出读完整报告的必要性。
5. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
6. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
7. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：每天由 AI agent + 人工 review 生成国际投行中文摘要与 KC评论，daily 更新约 10-40 页，并整理当天最新数据图表合集，方便喂给 AI，也方便人工快速把握 market dynamics。欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。。
8. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
9. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。它需要自然提到：每天会由 AI agent + 人工 review 生成国际投行中文摘要与 KC评论，daily 更新，约 10-40 页，也包含当天最新数据图表合集，既方便喂给 AI，也方便人工快速把握 market dynamics。

【KC评论要求】
- `KC评论` 不是复述原文，而是读者友好的解释、提醒或追问。
- 每条 `KC评论` 先说白话结论，再点出完整报告里值得继续看的图表、假设或细分拆解。
- 语气可以有判断力，但不要编造报告没有的数据或结论。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 不要隐藏报告机构名；标题必须出现机构中文名。正文如需概括来源，可写“这份摩根斯坦利研报”或“该机构报告”，但不要编造机构观点以外的信息。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

# China Energy & Chemicals | Asia Pacific

## China NOW: Oil Consumption

## Key Takeaways

China's implied gasoline and diesel demand weakened sharply in May, posting $12\%$ and $21\%$ declines YoY, respectively.

Jet fuel consumption remained resilient, rising roughly $5\%$ YoY, while naphtha consumption was broadly unchanged.

Total oil products consumption declined by 13.5% YoY in May, and down \~12% YoY since SOH disruption.

This suggests that the primary source of demand destruction remains road transportation and infrastructure building activity, rather than aviation or chemical.

We believe the weakness reflects a combination of softer economic activity, slowing infrastructure and logistics demand, and accelerating substitution toward EV-dominated shared-mobility - high oil prices likely encouraged consumers to shift mobility toward electric vehicles and public transit, further intensifying structural pressure on traditional transport fuel consumption.

Exhibit 1: China monthly fuel consumption (including inventory movement)
