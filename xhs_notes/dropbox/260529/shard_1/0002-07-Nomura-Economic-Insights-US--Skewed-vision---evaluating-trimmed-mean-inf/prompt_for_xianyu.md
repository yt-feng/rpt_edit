# US: Skewed vision – evaluating trimmed-mean inflation

- Fed Chair Kevin Warsh described core PCE inflation, the Fed's long-time preferred inflation metric, as a "rough swag" and proposed alternative inflation measures including trimmed-mean inflation.   
- PCE trimmed-mean inflation tends to be slow in detecting a change in the inflation trend, while underlying inflation trend measures indicate the risk of a new upward trend emerging recently.   
- We remain skeptical about the usefulness of PCE trimmed-mean inflation, whose method of removing outliers might not be optimal due to the recent shift in skewness of the cross-sectional inflation distribution. Trimmed-mean inflation might underestimate underlying inflation by about 48bp on a y-o-y basis.   
- A primary factor making PCE trimmed-mean inflation negatively biased is its failure to capture changes in goods price inflation dynamics in the post-pandemic era.

# What is PCE trimmed-mean inflation?

Monthly inflation data are noisy, and idiosyncratic moves by a few components can have an outsized effect. Policymakers aim to look through temporary noise and gauge the underlying trend of inflation. One of the simplest metrics that diminishes such noise is core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices. Most FOMC participants put a heavy weight on PCE core inflation as a gauge of the underlying trend.

Fed Chair Kevin Warsh has criticized PCE core inflation, describing it as a “rough swag” at his confirmation hearing. Instead, he proposed alternative inflation measures, including PCE trimmed-mean inflation and private sector price measures.

PCE trimmed-mean inflation is constructed from the cross-sectional distribution of monthly price changes and is designed to remove components with large monthly swings in either direction. Currently, the metric – published by the Dallas Fed – trims 24% from the lower tail and 31% from the upper tail of the distribution. The 12-month change in PCE trimmed-mean stood at 2.35% in April, 94bp lower than 3.29% for core PCE inflation (Fig. 1).

# Tracking "true inflation"

A key factor in evaluating the value of trimmed-mean inflation is whether it accurately captures “true inflation,” or underlying inflation. In order to assess whether PCE trimmed-mean inflation captures changes in the inflation trend in a timely manner, we calculate four “true” inflation trend series using ex-post data;

• A centered 36-month moving average of annualized monthly headline PCE inflation   
• A band-pass filtered annualized monthly headline PCE inflation   
- The average of annualized monthly PCE inflation for the contemporaneous and following 24 months   
- A centered 12-month moving average of a centered 24-month moving average of annualized headline PCE inflation

Among these four “true” inflation measures, a Dallas Fed economist used the first three to choose the optimal cutoffs when formulating PCE trimmed-mean inflation. Note that the optimal trimming proportions (24% of the lower tail and 31% of the upper tail) were determined to minimize the gap between PCE trimmed-mean inflation and the average of those true inflation measures over the period of January 1977 to June 2009. The last “true” inflation measure was a benchmark Cleveland Fed economists used to assess the usefulness of not-seasonally adjusted Median CPI inflation.

# Evaluating trimmed-mean's performance

# PCE trimmed-mean failed to detect the post-pandemic inflation surge

PCE trimmed-mean inflation is designed to look through idiosyncratic noise and avoid sending false positive signals about the underlying inflation trend. Thus, PCE trimmed-mean inflation is often better than core PCE inflation in the sense of fewer false signals of new inflation trends. However, that same feature can make it less responsive when a new inflation regime is emerging, especially if the initial shock is concentrated in a narrow set of components, leading to a change in skewness of the inflation distribution.

This limitation was evident during the post-pandemic inflation surge. At the onset of post-pandemic inflation acceleration, annualized monthly PCE trimmed-mean inflation lagged these four true inflation measures (Fig. 2). On the other hand, annualized monthly core PCE inflation started accelerating at almost the same time as the true measures, except for the average of future 24-month inflation (Fig. 3).
