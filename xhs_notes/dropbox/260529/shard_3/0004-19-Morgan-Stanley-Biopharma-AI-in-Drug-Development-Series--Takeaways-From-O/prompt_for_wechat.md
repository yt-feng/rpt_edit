你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断，例如“市场真正低估的不是需求，而是供给侧的再定价”。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：一句主判断，不超过 32 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
5. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
6. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。
7. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
8. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。可以类似“欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论”。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 默认避免出现具体投行品牌名，比如“GS”“GS”，统一写作“投行研报”。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

# AI in Drug Development Series: Takeaways From Our Call With Insilico Medicine

We hosted the CEO of Insilico Medicine, Alex Zhavoronkov, for a conversation on the role of AI in drug discovery. He highlighted faster early discovery, limited value of proprietary data, and balancing target novelty vs validation.

# We hosted an AI in drug discovery (AIDD) webcast with Insilico Medicine CEO

Alex Zhavoronkov (publicly listed in Hong Kong and covered by Jack Lin), which offered a pragmatic reframing of AI's role across drug discovery. While earlier industry narratives emphasized wholesale disruption, management now highlights that AI's impact is most tangible in accelerating and de-risking early discovery workflows rather than replacing core scientific functions. Insilico progressed 13 internally developed programs into the clinic (including three Phase 2 assets), underscoring its position as one of the more clinically validated AIDD platforms.

# The CEO opined on the limited durability of proprietary datasets as a

competitive moat in AIDD. Despite maintaining a large internally generated dataset—including >3,000 disease-target associations—the CEO argued that access to differentiated data alone has not translated into drug development success industrywide, highlighting a “graveyard” of data-centric companies that failed to deliver. Instead, he emphasized integrated benchmarking systems—Insilico maintains\~1.2K proprietary benchmarks—and model orchestration as more meaningful differentiators with performance ultimately constrained by broader industry limitations such as translatability of animal models and availability of disease-relevant assays.

# Organoids and other non-human alternatives may not replace animal studies in

the near term. Alex emphasized that the real bottleneck for AIDD is not safety validation, which may be partially replaceable, but rather the lack of efficacy for models in reliably translating to human disease. While safety testing can be improved through robotic labs, organoids, and existing primate data, companies cannot fully eliminate animal testing due to limited regulatory acceptance of fully animal-free validation packages. The larger challenge remains efficacy, especially in chronic and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and fibrosis, where short-lived mice or monkeys cannot naturally replicate long-cycle human pathology. Thus, current models often rely on artificial induction methods which have limited biological correlation with spontaneous human disease and limit their regulatory alignment without animal testing.

On commercialization, management stressed that achieving economic viability in AIDD requires thoughtful tradeoffs between target novelty and validation. While MS & CO. LLC

novel targets may command higher theoretical value, they typically require significant clinical de-risking (often through Phase 2) before attracting meaningful partner interest resulting in higher capital intensity and longer timelines. In contrast, programs against more validated targets, paired with improved molecular design, are more readily monetizable at earlier stages. Insilico's strategy has therefore shifted toward balancing novelty across target and chemistry to optimize out-licensing opportunities and drive a path toward profitability.

Finally, the discussion reinforced that AIDD's most validated benefit today lies in compressing early discovery timelines and reducing cost to preclinical candidate (PCC), rather than fundamentally altering clinical development timelines. Insilico cited \~12–18 months and \~\$3–5mn to reach PCC, with continued improvements in computational efficiency (from weeks to days). However, downstream development remains bounded by regulatory and biological constraints, with no meaningful acceleration expected in IND-enabling or clinical phases. Taken together, AIDD appears best positioned today as a productivity-enhancing layer within drug discovery, particularly in hit-to-lead and lead optimization, rather than a step-change disruptor of the broader R&D paradigm.
