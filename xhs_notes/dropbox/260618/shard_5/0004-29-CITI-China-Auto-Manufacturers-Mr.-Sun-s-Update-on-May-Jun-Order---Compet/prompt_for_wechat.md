你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断，例如“市场真正低估的不是需求，而是供给侧的再定价”。
- `# 标题` 必须包含报告机构的中文名称。已识别机构名：`Citi`。标题格式建议：`# Citi：一句主判断`。如果识别机构名为空，请从研报标题/正文中识别机构并使用中文名，例如GS、摩根斯坦利、HSBC、JPM、UBS、Citi、美国银行、BARC、DB、NOM。
- 机构名只要求出现在 `# 标题` 中，正文可以克制提及，不要为了重复机构名牺牲可读性。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：机构中文名 + 一句主判断，不超过 40 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
5. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
6. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。
7. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
8. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。可以类似“欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论”。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 不要隐藏报告机构名；标题必须出现机构中文名。正文如需概括来源，可写“这份Citi研报”或“该机构报告”，但不要编造机构观点以外的信息。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

# China Auto Manufacturers

Mr. Sun's Update on May/Jun Order & Competitive Dynamics

## CITI'S TAKE

We hosted an industry expert call with auto journalist Mr. Sun Shaojun 孙少军 on 16-June. Key takeaways include: (1) May/June market overview: Mr. Sun indicated overall PV sales in May were a miss. ICE sales collapsed while NEV was flattish MoM — The ICE sales plunge didn't benefit NEV due to muted customer purchase. Into June, the market is sustaining its tepid trend with market divergence — below Rmb200k NEV segment remains resilient while the luxury segment (traditional BBA & flagship SUVs of NEV brands) has seen a sharp order decline. (2) Potential stimulus rollout: Mr. Sun believes if the market remains sluggish, stimulus policy could be introduced for stabilization. Historical patterns show auto stimulus typically appears after July; therefore, Mr. Sun anticipates that the weaker the market performance, the higher the likelihood of stimulus policy being rolled out after July. (3) Mass-market BYD/Leapmotor weekly orders remained resilient at \~50k/13k units.

BYD — Last week's order was at 50k units (including BYD repurchased volume for overseas sales at <5k units), vs. 52k units two weeks ago. Given the robust overseas demand, Mr. Sun indicated that BYD has repurchased small battery PHEV models from dealers for overseas sales. The expert noted models with 2nd-gen blade batteries have also received decent customer feedback. The monthly production capacity of the 2nd-gen blade battery is ramping up at 20-30k units each month, according to BYD. Mr. Sun expects the launch of Great Tang (17-June) to further boost BYD's weekly order.

BBA competitive pressure — German luxury brands (BMW, Benz, Audi) continue to face structural headwinds. The expert noted BBA weekly orders declined to <7k units last week (vs. 11-12k last year), reflecting ongoing share loss to domestic premium NEV brands. BMW China's last week order at 6.5k, Audi China was at \~6k, Benz China at <7k units.

Xpeng — Last week's order was at 6k units (GX: 1-1.5k, MO3: 2k+), vs. 6.5k two weeks ago. Mr. Sun attributed the weekly order decline of GX to long delivery time.

Nio (excluding Onvo) - Last week's order was at 6.5k units (ES9: 2k, ES8: 2.5k, Firefly: 1.3k), vs. 7k+ two weeks ago (ES9: 2k+, ES8: 3k+). The expert highlighted strong sales visibility for the ES9, with steady-state weekly order expected at \~2k units.

Leapmotor — Last week's order was at 12.5-13k units (A10: 4-4.5k, B series: 2-3k, D19: 1.5k), vs. 13k two weeks ago. Upgraded C series will be launched on 16-June, which should boost Leapmotor's weekly order.

Li Auto — Last week's order was at 4.5k units with L series contributing \~2k units (L9: <1k units). The expert noted that ES9 and M9 weigh on the sales of L9.

Xiaomi — Last week's order was at 5k units (YU7: 2.5-3k, SU7: 2k), vs. 6k two weeks ago.

Tesla China — Last week's order was at 10k+ units (vs. 9-10k two weeks ago), with WoW growth driven by FSD set to launch in 2-3 weeks. (Continued...)

Huawei HIMA — Last week's order was at 11k units (AITO: \~7.5k, Luxeed: \~1.5k, Shangjie: \~1.5k, Maextro 1.1-1.2k), vs. 13k two weeks ago. Mr. Sun attributed tepid order of Maextro to the wait-and-see mode before the launch of S800 Grand Design (pre-sales order at 700-800 units), V680 and V800. The weekly order of Luxeed V9 and Shangjie Z7 is at 1.2-1.4k units respectively.

Denza — Last week's order was at 2k units, down from 3-3.5k units two weeks ago.

Zeekr — Last week's order was at 4k+ units (9X + 8X combined at 1.5k units), down from 5k units two weeks ago.

GAC Aion — Last week's order was at 4.5k units, up from 3k two week ago driven by the launch of i60.

IM Motor — Last week's order was at 1.6k units, down from 1.5k two weeks ago.

## Questions and Answers

Q: Views on Geely Galaxy, compared with BYD and Leapmotor?

A: Per Mr. Sun, Leapmotor (B10/A10) and BYD ( $2^{nd}$ -gen blade battery) have both benefited from BEV penetration growth this year, while Geely Galaxy suffered from PHEV penetration decline in 1H26 as most of its new 1H26 models were PHEV. Along with the launch of new BEV models in 2H26, Mr. Sun expects Geely Galaxy sales to see recovery.

Q: Outlook for Zeekr 9X and 8X?

A: Mr. Sun estimates the current order backlog of Zeekr 9X at 10-15k units, which could support delivery until July. Given lots of 5-seater SUVs are set to launch in 2H (AITO M8, Stelato G9, Nio ES8, Li L8), future sales visibility of Zeekr 8X seems low.

Q: Customer feedback of Stelato G9?

A: Mr. Sun is optimistic on the Stelato G9 sales outlook, given it's clearly differentiated with Huawei customer base.

Q: EREV penetration outlook?

A: Mr. Sun anticipates the EREV penetration decline trend to be sustained going forward, given EREV battery capacity has hit its ceiling with EV mileage at \~400km. Entry-level BEV (\~Rmb100k) can already achieve EV mileage of 600-700km, per Mr. Sun.

Q: Outlook on BYD weekly order after official launch of Great Tang?

A: Mr. Sun thinks the launch of Great Tang can boost BYD's order intake. The industry conversion rate from small order to big order (non-refundable) has declined from $60 - 70\%$ in the prior years to $35 - 40\%$ this year. Mr. Sun hopes the order conversion rate of Great Tang could be higher than the industry average.

Q: Outlook on JV brands?

A: Mr. Sun anticipates some joint-venture automakers may face production halts. This year JV brands may need to make a choice: either fully localize for the Chinese market or leave Chinese market altogether.

## Q: Views on raw material cost inflations?

A: Mr. Sun thinks some models could see price hikes in 2H26. In fact, some models have already begun to see price hikes. The launch prices for the Leapmotor A10 and the new BYD model are higher than expected, as the cost of rising raw materials has already been factored in.

## Appendix A-1

## ANALYST CERTIFICATION

The research analysts primarily responsible for the preparation and content of this research report are either (i) designated by “AC” in the author block or (ii) listed in bold alongside content which is attributable to that analyst. If multiple AC analysts are designated in the author block, each analyst is certifying with respect to the entire research report other than (a) content attributable to another AC certifying analyst listed in bold alongside the content and (b) views expressed solely with respect to a specific issuer which are attributable to another AC certifying analyst identified in the price charts or rating history tables for that issuer shown below. Each of these analysts certify, with respect to the sections of the report for which they are responsible: (1) that the views expressed therein accurately reflect their personal views about each issuer and security referenced and were prepared in an independent manner, including with respect to Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates; and (2) no part of the research analyst's compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst in this report.

## IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES

Analysts' compensation is determined by Citi management and Citi's senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the "Firm"). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis.

Unless stated otherwise neither the Research Analyst nor any member of their team has viewed the material operations of the Companies for which an investment view has been provided within the past 12 months.

## Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of $15\%$ or more or $25\%$ or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign “Rating Suspended” status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned “Under Review” status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

## Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds $15\%$ against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
