你是麦肯锡/投研风格的微信公众号财经文章主笔，擅长用金字塔原理把研报内容转化为“有主张、有层次、有洞察、但仍保留完整报告阅读欲望”的长文。

【目标】
- 基于下面的研报解析内容，写一篇微信公众号文章 Markdown。
- 风格：稳重、专业、克制、有洞察，像咨询公司合伙人写给高净值读者/产业决策者的研报导读。
- 长度：约 3000 字，允许上下浮动 15%。
- 不要使用 emoji。
- 可以基于报告内容做适度发散，但必须是从原文逻辑推出的判断，不要编造数据、公司动作或引用。
- 不要把研报所有正文内容讲完，要留下明确但自然的伏笔，让读者愿意加入社群阅读完整报告。

【金字塔原理写作原则】
1. 结论先行：文章开头先回答“这份报告最值得看的判断是什么”，而不是介绍背景。
2. 统领思想：全文只能服务一个主判断，避免变成摘要合集。
3. 纵向回答：每一层都要回答上一层提出的“为什么”或“所以呢”。
4. 横向 MECE：每个一级小节必须彼此独立、共同支撑主判断，避免重叠。
5. Synthesis over summary：不要复述报告段落，要提炼“这些事实合在一起意味着什么”。
6. So what：每个小节末尾必须落到对行业、公司、竞争格局、资产定价或读者观察框架的含义。
7. Action title：所有 `##` 小标题必须是“直接讲述洞察的完整句子”，不能是目录标签。

【标题与小标题硬性要求】
- `# 标题` 必须短、锐利、可转发，优先 18-30 个中文字符，最长不超过 36 个中文字符。
- `# 标题` 必须直接表达一个判断或悬念，例如“黄金缺的不是央行，是ETF”。
- `# 标题` 必须包含一个传播钩子，但只能用报告中真实出现或可由报告标题明确推出的信息：
  1. 机构 big name：GS、MS、JPM、UBS、Citi、美联储等。
  2. 中国读者熟悉的人名 big name：洪灏、邢自强、辜朝明；国际公众人物：特朗普、马斯克、鲍威尔等。
  3. 反常识或意外差：例如市场普遍悲观时，报告给出“触底”“修复”“再加速”等相反信号。
- 已识别机构名：`Bernstein`。如果识别机构名为空，请从研报标题/正文中识别机构并使用中文名，例如GS、MS、HSBC、JPM、UBS、Citi、美国银行、BARC、DB、NOM。
- 标题里不要同时写中文机构名和英文缩写，禁止“JPM：JPM：……”“GS：GS：……”这类重复；写“JPM：……”或“GS：……”即可。
- 标题可以用问句或对比句，但不要标题党到超出原报告证据。避免“震惊”“爆了”“彻底反转”“一夜变天”等廉价词。
- 标题不要晦涩抽象。少用“结构性分化”“二阶影响”“再定价框架”这类泛化词；如果必须使用，要落到一个具体对象。
- 机构名只要求出现在 `# 标题` 中，正文可以克制提及，不要为了重复机构名牺牲可读性。
- 禁止使用以下机械标题：
  - 一、核心判断
  - 二、真正重要的是结构性变量
  - 三、报告没有说透
  - 四、对读者的启发
  - 关键变化
  - 投资启示
  - 总结
- 所有 `##` 标题都要像麦肯锡报告里的 action title：读完标题就知道这一节结论。
- 小标题可以带序号，但序号后必须是一句洞察，例如：`## 1. 这轮变化真正考验的是企业能否把规模转化为议价权`。

【建议结构，但不要机械照抄标题】
1. `# 标题`：机构中文名或报告中的 big name + 一句主判断，不超过 36 字。
2. 开头 4-6 段：直接给出主判断、为什么现在重要、报告提供了什么新信号。
3. 4-6 个 `##` 小节：每个小节标题都是洞察句，不是栏目名。
4. 在正文中穿插 2-4 个 `> **KC评论：** ...` 引用块，每个 1-3 句，用更平白的话解释“这张图/这个判断对读者意味着什么”，并自然引出读完整报告的必要性。
5. 至少一个小节讨论“报告尚未完全回答的关键问题”，但标题也要是洞察句。
6. 至少一个小节给出读者的观察框架，但不要命名为“对读者的启发”。
7. 文末自然承接未解问题，引导读者加入社群/微信群继续讨论。不要照抄固定话术，请基于本文未解问题每次重新写一段自然 CTA；语义可以参考：每天由 AI agent + 人工 review 生成国际投行中文摘要与 KC评论，daily 更新约 10-40 页，并整理当天最新数据图表合集，方便喂给 AI，也方便人工快速把握 market dynamics。欢迎来星球微信群里继续讨论。。
8. 在免责声明前，单独插入这张图片链接：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`
9. 结尾只输出英文灰色免责声明：`<p style="color:#999999;font-size:12px;">Personal reading notes and learning share only. Not investment advice.</p>`

【hook 要求】
- 不要硬插“加入社群”。
- hook 应该来自正文自然出现的未解问题，比如：关键假设尚未验证、竞争优势仍需拆解、图表背后的二阶影响没有展开。
- 文末 CTA 要像“顺着这些未解问题继续读完整报告/继续讨论”，不是广告口吻。
- CTA 必须每篇重新写，不能固定输出“加入社群，领取完整研报解读与原始图表”。它需要自然提到：每天会由 AI agent + 人工 review 生成国际投行中文摘要与 KC评论，daily 更新，约 10-40 页，也包含当天最新数据图表合集，既方便喂给 AI，也方便人工快速把握 market dynamics。

【KC评论要求】
- `KC评论` 不是复述原文，而是读者友好的解释、提醒或追问。
- 每条 `KC评论` 先说白话结论，再点出完整报告里值得继续看的图表、假设或细分拆解。
- 语气可以有判断力，但不要编造报告没有的数据或结论。

【图片要求】
- 不要主动生成 MinerU 图片 markdown；系统会在文章生成后自动插入 MinerU 原始图片。
- 但文末免责声明前必须保留知识星球图片：`![](https://github.com/yt-feng/rpt_edit/blob/main/prompts/zsxq_img.jpg)`。

【内容边界】
- 只能基于研报原文和解析结果推导，不要编造数据、公司动作、引用。
- 遇到不确定内容，要用“这里仍需验证”“报告没有完全展开”等表达。
- 避免“震惊”“爆款”“一文看懂”等浮夸表达。
- 不要出现小红书话题标签。
- 不要出现 emoji。
- 不要隐藏报告机构名；标题必须出现机构中文名。正文如需概括来源，可写“这份Bernstein研报”或“该机构报告”，但不要编造机构观点以外的信息。
- 不要解释你的思考过程，不要输出多余说明。

# Korea E-commerce: Seeing is believing 2026... Online grocery shopping reality check

What began as a simple consumer task - purchasing yogurt and a BTS collaboration ramen for a short stay in Korea - quickly evolved into a grounded comparison of four major grocery platforms: Coupang, Naver Shopping with Kurly, SSG.com, and Baemin B-Mart. This exercise highlights a key reality for investors: the competitive landscape in quick commerce is not determined solely by headline pricing, but by the interplay of pricing structure, delivery thresholds, and assortment availability in real consumer scenarios.

Coupang - Lowest price, but structural friction. Coupang emerges as the clear leader on absolute pricing. However, this leadership is partially offset by structural friction embedded in its delivery system. Specifically, Rocket Fresh requires a KRW 15,000 minimum based on discounted prices rather than listing prices, and products outside the Fresh category do not contribute to this threshold. In practice, this creates inefficiencies in basket construction: in this case, the ramen was only available under Rocket delivery, meaning it could not be combined with Fresh items to meet the free delivery requirement. While Coupang wins on price, category segmentation introduces meaningful limitations to real-world usability.

Naver and Kurly - Easier threshold, hidden advantage. In contrast, Naver Shopping and Kurly benefit from a more consumer-friendly threshold mechanism. Their free delivery requirements are based on listing prices rather than post-discount payment amounts, making it materially easier for users to qualify for free shipping. This seemingly subtle distinction has meaningful implications. When the threshold is met, the effective total cost becomes competitive with Coupang, particularly for multi-item baskets - further supported by 3%+ cash rewards from Naver Shopping membership. As such, their advantage lies less in headline pricing and more in structural flexibility, enabling smoother basket formation and fewer forced purchasing decisions.

SSG.com - Assortment gap still a constraint. SSG.com, on the other hand, illustrates the continued importance of assortment depth in online grocery. The absence of the specific Greek yogurt brand sought in this case highlights a broader issue: online SKU availability remains narrower than offline equivalents. This gap directly constrains demand capture, regardless of pricing or delivery competitiveness. However, the limitation appears at least partially linked to regulatory constraints around online fulfillment from offline stores. Should policies evolve to enable broader integration - such as expanded dawn delivery from physical retail locations - SSG.com's assortment gap could narrow.

Baemin B-Mart - Speed over everything, at a price. Baemin's B-Mart reflects a distinctly different strategic positioning. Bamin is clearly driving quick commerce, prioritizing speed and convenience. While the platform did carry the specific items required, its pricing was significantly higher than competitors, and overall SKU breadth remained limited. The result is a sharply defined but narrow use case: B-Mart is best suited for urgent, short-window delivery needs within 1-2 hours, rather than routine grocery shopping. Its value proposition is therefore situational, with premium pricing acting as a barrier to broader adoption despite strong last-mile capabilities.

## INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS

## We have Outperform rating on Naver; Underperform rating on Coupang.

Unlike market concerns that Naver's shift toward the Naver Neocloud business will consume its resources, the company appears to be continuing its push in commerce. As a meaningful portion of Naver's operating cash flow is generated from digital search advertising and commerce ad (KRW 3 trillion in 2025), it is likely to sustain investment in its commerce segment to support future initiatives. At the same time, given that industry-wide commerce margins are largely determined by competitive intensity, we believe ongoing price competition may put pressure on both Naver Platform margins and Coupang's Product Commerce margins.

## DETAILS

EXHIBIT 1: Coupang leads on absolute pricing, but its KRW 15,000 Fresh-only threshold and inability to combine Rocket items create basket inefficiencies that limit real-world usability.

EXHIBIT 2: With a 30% membership coupon on June 22, the deal on Naver/Kurly looks attractive, supported by a more favorable free shipping threshold.

EXHIBIT 3: SSG.com underscores an assortment constraint - limited SKU availability, driven partly by offline-to-online fulfillment restrictions, caps demand capture today but could improve if regulatory integration evolves.

EXHIBIT 4: Baemin B-Mart prioritizes ultra-fast delivery with adequate item availability, but higher pricing and limited assortment confine its value to urgent, short-window needs rather than everyday grocery shopping.

The high free delivery threshold on Baemin reduces overall cost competitiveness.
