# Read-across from adidas' 2Q26 results

Operating profit miss, footwear sales also slowed down; continued market share gain in China in 2Q26

adidas delivered solid revenue growth in 2Q26, but missed expectation on OP
adidas (ADS GR, Not rated) reported its 1H26 results (30 July), missing the capital market's high expectations: quarterly revenue increased by 14% y-y to EUR6.7bn, slightly ahead of Bloomberg consensus of EUR6.6bn; quarterly operating profit went up by a slower 5% y-y to EUR574mn, missing consensus of EUR616mn, due to increased sales/branding efforts that have dragged the quarterly OP margin by 0.7ppt y-y to 8.5%. Meanwhile, adidas' core footwear segment has only grown its sales by 1% y-y in 2Q26, slowing down from 1Q26's 4% y-y growth. Management also kept its full-year operating profit guidance of EUR2.3bn, lower than Bloomberg consensus of EUR2.5bn.

## Continued market share gain in China in 2Q26

For the Greater China market, adidas has continued to gain market share with a $15\%$ y-y sales growth in 2Q26, marginally slowing down from the $17\%$ y-y sales growth in 1Q26. According to our June channel check with an expert with deep knowledge of the China sportswear sector (see our report), adidas delivered solid growth momentum in 2Q26 in mainland China with mid- to high-teens% y-y sales growth, which came in largely consistent with the company's 2Q26 results. As indicated in the company's 2Q26 results, adidas still enjoys significant competitive edge in key segments like running and sports leisure in China, helped by its more advanced localization of product design and channel operation as compared to its international peers (e.g. re-naming of the outdoor segment, adidas Terrex, as 山川里 specifically for the China market), according to the company. With the mediocre consumption sentiment in China and fierce competition from names like adidas in the sportswear sector, ANTA (2020 HK, Buy) remains our preferred name, given its exposure to the structural growth opportunities (especially running and outdoor activities) in the long term and attractive valuation levels.

## Key takeaways from adidas' 2Q26 results

\- 2Q26 revenue growth in Europe, North America, Great China, South Korea/Japan, and Latin America reached +6%, +17%, +15%, +18%, and +28% y-y, respectively, compared with +6%, +12%, +17%, +23%, and +26% y-y, respectively, in 1Q26. Among the regions, currency-neutral revenue growth rate of Europe and Great China was lower than the Bloomberg consensus estimates of 8.7%/15.8% in 2Q26, respectively.

\- By product, footwear, apparel, and accessories division registered +1%, +35%, and +20% y-y sales growth in 2Q26, compared with +4%, +31%, and +13% y-y in 1Q26.

\- By channel, 2Q26 revenue from the DTC channel rose by $23\%$ y-y for offline retail and online sales registered a $27\%$ y-y growth; revenue from the wholesale channel was up by $6\%$ y-y in 2Q26.

\- The company raised its FY2026E revenue growth outlook to $9 - 10\%$ y-y (previous guidance of high-single-digit% y-y revenue growth in 2026E).

\- adidas' management has observed that affluent consumers are increasingly gravitating toward the brand, driven by the successful localization of its global concepts by regional teams, as well as consistent execution across retail channels.

\- Management mentioned that adidas' local team in China has achieved significantly greater operational command over the business compared to previous periods.

\- On Nike's (NKE US, Not rated) recent adjustment on online DTC strategy in China, adidas management viewed that this adjustment on wholesale distribution channels should take more time to be effective, and the impact remains uncertain in the short term.
