# Horizon Robotics (9660.HK)

Expect >65% 1H GPM; 3 Catalysts on mean re-version

## CITI'S TAKE

Horizon Robotics released its 1H26 profit warning, with 1H26 profit turned positive to Rmb3,500-4,000mn (from 1H25 loss of Rmb5,233mn) driven by fair value fluctuations of convertible loans issued to CARIAD (JV with Volkswagen). Citi's view on 1H26 results: (1) Revenue: We expect 1H26 operating revenue to hit guidance upper-range at >34% YoY given its market share gain amid rollout of full-scenario NOA solutions. (2) 1H26 GPM should hit upper-range at 65-66% due to blended ASP increase from market share/mix gain, as well as cost reduction due to 7nm chips' controllable environments. (3) 1H26 adjusted net loss \~Rmb1,500mn considering fair value reversal of convertible loans. (4) We believe Horizon to maintain FY26 revenue growth target at +50% YoY, implying 2H26 revenue to accelerate from 1H26's +34% YoY, supported by 6-7 Volkswagen models launch, wallet share gain within BYD God's Eye B, new orders from Chery and seasonal demand recovery from August.

Catalysts: (1) We expect Horizon may announce L3/L4 cooperation plan with major global auto makers, which may generate billions of RMB IP income in the next 3 years with 95% GPM. (2) We expect Horizon to further expand its market share via penetrating into BYD God's Eye C (wallet share hiking to 90-100%) and Eye B solutions (wallet share also to rise) in 2H26—we recognize a major reason for Horizon Robotics' previous share price decline was due to investors' concerns on its wallet shares within BYD. (3) NVIDIA's hardware market share loss in China ADAS market would potentially harm its platform-related software makers, which could improve Horizon Robotics competitiveness.

Valuation—Compare with Mobileye: Horizon Robotics current market cap is at HK\$64.8bn (US\$8.3bn) with share price of HK\$4.45. Given we expect ADAS to see strong ramp-up stage before 2030E, we value Horizon by applying 2030E P/E to factor in its terminal net profit. By assigning 30x 2030E P/E and discounting it back on 11% WACC, we derive our target price of HK\$12.3 (HK\$179.8bn market cap). The market cap of Horizon Robotics now (US\$8.3bn) is close to Mobileye at US\$7.5bn (while Mobileye has no AD, but only has ADAS); we believe the market has not factored in Horizon Robotics' autonomous driving (AD) business, as well as its market share gain results, and 2H26 China EV growth seasonality and the 3 catalysts we mentioned above.

1H26 core operational metrics based on announcement: (1) Operating revenue grew 24.8%-34.5% YoY to Rmb1,930-2,080mn; (2) Gross profit expanded 13.7%-34.3% YoY to Rmb1,160-1,370mn with gross margin at 60%-66% range; (3) Adjusted net loss widened by 5.1%-27.6% YoY to Rmb1,400-1,700mn. Mgmt.

highlighted two major growth pillars in 1H26: mass rollout of full-scenario NOA solutions and rising licensing income from its underlying chip and foundational AI model stack.

## Horizon Robotics

## Valuation

Given we expect ADAS to see strong ramp-up stage in 2025-30E, we value Horizon by applying 2030E P/E to factor in its terminal net profit. By assuming (1) 2030E 100% L2+ ADAS penetration in China PV market and 45% market share of Horizon Robotics in L2+ ADAS field backed by its leading position in domestic ADAS chip supply, (2) blended ASP of USD254, (3) stable growth of licenses & service revenue, (4) NPM of 30.6%, we forecast Horizon's 2030E NP at Rmb8.86bn. By assigning 30x 2030E P/E (similar to the non-weighted avg 2026E P/E of MBLY/NVDA/TXN) and discounting it back on 11% WACC, we derive our target price of HK\$12.3, equivalent to 26.5x/15.9x/9.8x 2026/27/28E P/S.

## Risks

We rate Horizon Robotics High Risk given its limited operating history and current loss-making status. Key downside risks that could impede the shares from reaching our target price include: (1) limited operating history; (2) uncertain R&D outcomes; (3) competition and regulatory risk; (4) risk on supply chain dependency; (5) customer concentration risk; (6) geopolitical and compliance risks; and (7) market adoption uncertainty.

## Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign "Rating Suspended" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned "Under Review" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

## Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
