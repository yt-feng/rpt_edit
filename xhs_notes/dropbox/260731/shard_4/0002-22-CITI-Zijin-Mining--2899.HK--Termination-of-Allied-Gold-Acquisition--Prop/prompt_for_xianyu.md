# Zijin Mining (2899.HK)

Termination of Allied Gold Acquisition; Proposed Acquisition of 9.2% Equity Interest Through Private Placement

## CITI'S TAKE

On 29th Jul, Zijin announced that it terminates the proposed acquisition of 100% equity shareholding in Allied Gold (see our note) as there is no reasonable likelihood that all conditions to completion of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived by the outside date or within a reasonable time thereafter and no termination fee is owed or payable by either party. Meanwhile, Zijin Gold International entered an agreement with Allied Gold to subscribe 12.8mn shares with price of CAD32.55/sh (vs. CAD44/sh in the previous plan of 100% acquisition). The total consideration is CAD416.6mn (US\$295mn) and Zijin Gold International will own 9.2% of equity interest in Allied Gold after the private placement. We expect the equity investment in Allied Gold implies potential cooperation in the future and Zijin could relaunch the acquisition if geopolitical risks in Mali are reduced. Maintain as Top Pick.

## Catalyst Watch on Zijin Mining (2899.HK)

Direction: Upside

Duration: Within 30 Days (expires 05 Aug 2026)

Date Added: 05 Jul 2026

Catalyst: Earnings

We expect Zijin, a high-quality industry leader, will be on top of investors' list when the market revisits Zijin's positioning in value sectors and after 30%+ correction from its previous highs. We expect Zijin's 1H26 earnings will rise strongly, up 70%+ YoY. The company should announce preliminary results in July. Its plan to produce 120kt lithium (LCE) should also boost its 2H earnings. We also see the possibility of more shareholder return actions ahead (buybacks, etc.) considering attractive valuations and amid investor feedback to management suggesting such actions.

## Zijin Mining

## Valuation

We value Zijin-H at HK\$51.80/share. In our DCF, we assume 2.5% terminal growth and a WACC of 8.2% (a 3.5% risk free rate, 1.05 beta and a 7% market risk premium) to reach a value of HK\$48.2/sh. We also estimate Kamoa NPV at HK\$3.6/sh. As a result, our NPV for Zijin-H works out to HK\$51.80/sh.

## Risks

Major downside risks that could prevent the shares from reaching our target price include: 1) lower-than-expected gold and copper prices; 2) capex overruns in projects under development; 3) cost inflation that erodes profitability; and 4) lower than expected gold and copper output.

Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign "Rating Suspended" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned "Under Review" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds 15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
