# Glass Fiber & E-Fabric - Weekly Snapshot - 20260716

## CITI'S TAKE

China's glass fiber market remained bifurcated in the week ended Jul 16. Coarse roving prices continued to face pressure as seasonal demand weakness persisted, with downstream processors operating at low utilization rates and inventory gradually increasing. In contrast, electronic yarn fundamentals remained exceptionally strong. Following the latest round of price hikes, G75 and electronic fabric prices stabilized at elevated levels, with downstream CCL demand remaining robust. Despite stable overall capacity, effective electronic yarn supply remains constrained as newly added capacity has yet to fully ramp up and high-end product availability remains limited. We continue to expect electronic yarn to outperform, supported by tight supply-demand dynamics, low inventories and strong pricing power. Maintain Buy on Jushi.

Pricing – 1) The mainstream transaction price for 2400tex winding direct roving remained at Rmb3,500-3,900/ton, with the national average at Rmb3,768.5/ton, down 0.26% WoW but up 3.27% YoY. Price pressure continued in selected regions as producers prioritized shipment and inventory control amid weak demand. 2) G75 electronic yarn prices remained stable at Rmb16,800-17,500/ton, with the average transaction price at approximately Rmb16,987.5/ton, flat WoW after the recent sharp increases. 3) 7628 electronic fabric prices stayed elevated at Rmb8.5-8.7/meter, with transaction volume-based negotiation continuing.

Supply – 122 furnace lines were in operation this past week, with total capacity unchanged at 9.038mtpa, flat WoW and up 8.03% YoY. No production line changes were reported during the week. While coarse roving inventory increased slightly due to weak shipments, electronic yarn and electronic fabric inventories remained low. Downstream electronic customers continued to face supply constraints, with some producers showing limited willingness to accept additional new orders.

Demand – 1) Roving: demand remained weak as high temperatures and rainfall in southern China continued to weigh on downstream processing activity. Most deep-processing customers maintained low operating rates, resulting in limited procurement enthusiasm and weak shipment momentum. 2) Electronic yarn: demand remained resilient, with CCL customers continuing to actively secure supply. Despite stable prices after recent increases, multiple specifications remained in short supply, while high-end product orders continued to grow.

Not for distribution in the People's Republic of China, excluding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors.

Outlook – 1) Roving: prices are expected to remain under pressure in the near term as seasonal weakness persists, inventory digestion remains challenging and downstream demand recovery is limited. 2) Electronic yarn: prices are expected to remain stable in the short term, but medium-term upside potential remains intact. Monthly orders are largely committed, while supply constraints, low inventories and strong CCL demand should continue to support further price increases.

## China Jushi

(600176.SS; Rmb43.8; 1; 17 Jul 26; 15:00)

## Valuation

Our target price for Jushi of Rmb67/sh is based on 26x 2027E P/E, equivalent to +1 standard deviation above the stock's historical average P/E since listing, but still below the current forward valuation of relevant peers. We set our TP based on 2027E earnings, as we believe it better captures the full-year earnings benefits from higher E-fabric pricing, capacity ramp-up and product-mix upgrades. We believe our target multiple is justified by Jushi's global cost leadership, integrated electronic yarn-and-cloth platform and superior earnings leverage to the ongoing E-fabric upcycle, while also noting we do not yet assign any material value to its longer-dated capacity expansion or potential upside from specialty E-fabric products.

## Risks

Major downside risks to the share price include: 1) weaker-than-expected demand for glass fiber products; 2) rising energy/power costs; and 3) greater-than-expected capacity additions. Major upside risks include: 1) better-than-expected demand; and 2) supply-side discipline that helps protect margins.

Any of these risk factors could cause the shares to deviate from our target price.

Citi Global Markets Inc. or its affiliates currently has, or had within the past 12 months, the following as clients, and the services provided were non-investment-banking, non-securities-related: China Jushi.

Analysts' compensation is determined by Citi management and Citi's senior management and is based upon activities and services intended to benefit the investor clients of Citi Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the "Firm"). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking, sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a positive view of the company.

For financial instruments recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in such financial instruments (and any underlying instruments) and may act as principal in connection with transactions in such instruments. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis.

## Guide to Citi Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:

Citi stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks. Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.

Investment Ratings: Citi investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return ("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The target price is based on a 12 month time horizon. The Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of $15\%$ or more or $25\%$ or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR. Citi may suspend its rating and target price and assign "Rating Suspended" status for regulatory and/or internal policy reasons. Citi may also suspend its rating and target price and assign "Under Review" status for other exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the analyst's thesis, trading suspension) affecting the company and/or trading in the company's securities. In both such situations, the rating and target price will show as “—” and “-” respectively in the rating history price chart. Prior to 11 April 2022 Citi assigned "Under Review" status to both situations and prior to 11 Nov 2020 only in exceptional circumstances. As soon as practically possible, the analyst will publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations will be permitted but will become subject to review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.

## Catalyst Watch/Short Term Views ("STV") Ratings Disclosure:

Catalyst Watch and STV Upside/Downside calls: Citi may also include a Catalyst Watch or STV Upside or Downside call to indicate the analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over a specified period of 30 or 90 days in reaction to one or more specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the market. A Catalyst Watch will be published when Analyst confidence is high that an impact to share price will occur; it will be a STV when confidence level is moderate. A Catalyst Watch or STV Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at the end of the specified 30/90 day period. The Catalyst Watch will also be automatically removed if share price performance (calculated at market close) exceeds

15% against the direction of the call (unless over-ridden by the analyst). The analyst may also remove a Catalyst Watch or STV call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research note. A Catalyst Watch/STV Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock's fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch/STV Upside call corresponds to a buy recommendation and a Catalyst Watch/STV Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside, Catalyst Watch Downside, STV Upside, or STV Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch/STV No View. For purposes of FINRA ratings distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond Catalyst Watch/STV No View to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider No View to be a recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch/STV Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as expected.
