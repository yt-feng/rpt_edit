You are a senior financial newsletter editor with a consulting-style strategy lens. You turn research-report material into a long-form English article that is structured, insightful, and suitable for a serious business audience.

Objective:
- Write an English Markdown article based on the report parsing below.
- Target length: around 2200 words, plus or minus 15%.
- Tone: serious, analytical, strategic, and readable.
- The article should not feel like a summary. It should make an argument.
- You may extend the report's logic into reasonable second-order implications, but do not invent data, company actions, or quotes.
- Do not disclose every detail. Leave several meaningful open questions that make readers want the full report.

McKinsey-style writing principles:
1. Answer first: open with the controlling idea, not background.
2. Governing thought: every section must support the main answer.
3. Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive logic: avoid overlapping sections.
4. So what: every section must explain why the point matters.
5. Synthesis over summary: do not list facts; interpret what the pattern means.
6. Action titles: section headings must be complete, insight-bearing sentences. Do not use generic headings such as "Key Takeaways", "Market Background", "Core View", or "Reader Implications".
7. Natural hooks: if you want readers to join the community or read the full report, the hook should emerge from unresolved analytical questions, not from promotional language.

Required Markdown structure:
- `# Title`: make it a direct argument, not a topic label.
- Opening: 4-6 short paragraphs that state the main thesis and why now matters.
- 4-6 `##` sections. Each `##` heading must be an action title: a sentence that tells the reader the insight.
- One section should identify what the report does not fully answer yet.
- One section should translate the report into a decision framework for readers.
- Final section: naturally invite readers to join the community or read the full report using this CTA: Join the community to read the full report and review the original charts.
- End with: `*This article is for learning and discussion only and does not constitute investment advice.*`

Content boundaries:
- Do not mention specific investment bank names such as GS. Use "a global investment bank report" if needed.
- Do not use emoji.
- Do not write like a viral post.
- Do not output your reasoning process.
- Do not generate image Markdown; the system will insert original MinerU images afterward.

## Physical AI: From NeuralAxis blueprint to Unitree

Blueprint to product: Unitree WVLA2.0 operationalises the NeuralAxis doctrine

On 15 June 2026 we visited Unitree (Unlisted) to update on the company's latest developments (Takeaways from Unitree visit ahead of its listing). This report frames Physical AI commercialisation around two complementary layers: a "system-architecture blueprint and safety doctrine" for landing Physical AI in the real world, and, following the test release of Unitree's WVLA2.0 (World-model Vision-Language-Action) embodied large model, our read on how Unitree turns that blueprint into a shipping product and a commercial roadmap through model fusion and hardware-software co-design.

## NeuralAxis by NXP: The reflex-first blueprint for physical AI

The NeuralAxis (Neural Axis Architecture) framework was proposed by NXP (NXPI US, Not rated), unveiled by President and CEO Rafael Sotomayor at the COMPUTEX 2026 keynote. Its premise is that Physical AI's binding constraint is not scaling language-model reasoning but engineering a low-latency reflex layer akin to human unconscious response, consistent with Moravec's paradox. NeuralAxis mirrors the human nervous system across three decoupled yet coordinated tiers: a reasoning layer (cortex, \~300ms), a coordination layer (cerebellum) for motion control and balance, and a reflex layer (spinal cord, as low as 40ms) pushed to the edge near actuators—jointly delivering low latency, distributed control and high energy efficiency. The implication for humanoids is most acute: rather than a central brain, reflex processors are distributed to joints, hands and feet, enabling local autonomous decisions—grip-force control, ankle balancing—and chained recovery of balance, grasping, posture and gait within 40ms, while decoupling reasoning from motion control preserves stable locomotion as new skills are added. The same blueprint compresses drone glass-to-glass latency to within 20ms and segments software-defined-vehicle control into reasoning, coordination and safety-critical zonal execution. On commercialisation, our industry checks indicate meaningful manufacturing productivity uplift versus conventional automation and a likely sharp rise in diagnostic-robot sales.

From blueprint to product: WVLA2.0's world-model-VLA fusion and co-design

While the NeuralAxis document defines Physical AI's architecture blueprint and safety doctrine, Unitree's WVLA2.0 minutes show how that blueprint becomes a product through model fusion and hardware-software co-design. WVLA2.0, the first commercially deployable iteration after two years of development, fuses the WMA (World-Model Action) model's predictive capability with VLA's end-to-end action generation, diverging from peers betting solely on VLA. The architecture upgrades high-level task comprehension, 2D/3D spatial-semantic reasoning, dynamics-constrained action generation and disturbance resistance. Perception fuses four parallel visual streams—an RealSense (Unlisted) depth camera, a Livox (Unlisted) MID360 LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and two side cameras—into a 360-degree representation, with position updates within 10ms under interference. On co-design, post-inference action parameters are dispatched via CAN (controller area network) bus to the G1's 23-degree-of-freedom joints, leveraging Unitree's "cerebellum" motion control; single-arm grasping of sub-2kg objects holds positioning error within 5mm. Lightweighting caps edge compute below 100 TOPS, running fully on the G1 EDU's NVIDIA (NVDA US, Not rated) Jetson Orin NX without cloud dependence, avoiding latency- and disconnection-driven task interruption, in management's account.

## Embodiment-free data capture becomes mainstream

The data-collection paradigm is shifting decisively toward "embodiment-free" capture as the mainstream approaches. In a single-take demo, a WVLA2.0-equipped G1 autonomously completed six tasks in a disturbed meeting room without teleoperation,

evidencing long-horizon execution and a perception-prediction-decision-action closed loop at \~90ms per inference, roughly ten iterations per second. Our industry checkssuggest some limitations: blind spots and rear-area perception gaps, elevated noise, slow execution and imprecise fine manipulation, alongside a lack of quantified continuous success-rate benchmarks. Management guides industrial manufacturing—joint-motor assembly, loading, fixture handling—as the earliest landing zone given Unitree's in-house factories, followed by logistics sorting, flexible 3C assembly, and later home and healthcare scenarios, where open, unstructured environments raise difficulty sharply. Management views Unitree's differentiation as full-stack in-house integration plus large-scale real-machine data from its global fleet—an asset cloud-only model vendors cannot replicate.

## Definition of NOM Group's equity research rating system and sectors

The rating system is a relative system, indicating expected performance against a specific benchmark identified for each individual stock, subject to limited management discretion. An analyst's target price is an assessment of the current intrinsic fair value of the stock based on an appropriate valuation methodology determined by the analyst. Valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, discounted cash flow analysis, expected return on equity and multiple analysis. Analysts may also indicate expected absolute upside/downside relative to the stated target price, defined as (target price - current price)/current price.

## STOCKS

A rating of 'Buy', indicates that the analyst expects the stock to outperform the Benchmark over the next 12 months. A rating of 'Neutral', indicates that the analyst expects the stock to perform in line with the Benchmark over the next 12 months. A rating of 'Reduce', indicates that the analyst expects the stock to underperform the Benchmark over the next 12 months. A rating of 'Suspended', indicates that the rating, target price and estimates have been suspended temporarily to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies. Securities and/or companies that are labelled as 'Not rated' or shown as 'No rating' are not in regular research coverage. Investors should not expect continuing or additional information from NOM relating to such securities and/or companies. Benchmarks are as follows: United States/Europe/Asia ex-Japan: please see valuation methodologies for explanations of relevant benchmarks for stocks, which can be accessed at:

http://go.NOMnow.com/research/m/Disclosures; Global Emerging Markets (ex-Asia): MSCI Emerging Markets ex-Asia, unless otherwise

stated in the valuation methodology; Japan: Russell/NOM Large Cap.

## SECTORS

A 'Bullish' stance, indicates that the analyst expects the sector to outperform the Benchmark during the next 12 months. A 'Neutral' stance, indicates that the analyst expects the sector to perform in line with the Benchmark during the next 12 months. A 'Bearish' stance, indicates that the analyst expects the sector to underperform the Benchmark during the next 12 months. Sectors that are labelled as 'Not rated' or shown as 'N/A' are not assigned ratings. Benchmarks are as follows: United States: S&P 500; Europe: Dow Jones STOXX 600; Global Emerging Markets (ex-Asia): MSCI Emerging Markets ex-Asia. Japan/Asia ex-Japan: Sector ratings are not assigned.

## Target Price

A Target Price, if discussed, indicates the analyst's forecast for the share price with a 12-month time horizon, reflecting in part the analyst's estimates for the company's earnings. The achievement of any target price may be impeded by general market and macroeconomic trends, and by other risks related to the company or the market, and may not occur if the company's earnings differ from estimates.
