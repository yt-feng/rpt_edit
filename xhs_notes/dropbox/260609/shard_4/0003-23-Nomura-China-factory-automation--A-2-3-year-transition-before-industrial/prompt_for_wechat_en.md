You are a senior financial newsletter editor with a consulting-style strategy lens. You turn research-report material into a long-form English article that is structured, insightful, and suitable for a serious business audience.

Objective:
- Write an English Markdown article based on the report parsing below.
- Target length: around 2200 words, plus or minus 15%.
- Tone: serious, analytical, strategic, and readable.
- The article should not feel like a summary. It should make an argument.
- You may extend the report's logic into reasonable second-order implications, but do not invent data, company actions, or quotes.
- Do not disclose every detail. Leave several meaningful open questions that make readers want the full report.

McKinsey-style writing principles:
1. Answer first: open with the controlling idea, not background.
2. Governing thought: every section must support the main answer.
3. Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive logic: avoid overlapping sections.
4. So what: every section must explain why the point matters.
5. Synthesis over summary: do not list facts; interpret what the pattern means.
6. Action titles: section headings must be complete, insight-bearing sentences. Do not use generic headings such as "Key Takeaways", "Market Background", "Core View", or "Reader Implications".
7. Natural hooks: if you want readers to join the community or read the full report, the hook should emerge from unresolved analytical questions, not from promotional language.

Required Markdown structure:
- `# Title`: make it a direct argument, not a topic label.
- Opening: 4-6 short paragraphs that state the main thesis and why now matters.
- 4-6 `##` sections. Each `##` heading must be an action title: a sentence that tells the reader the insight.
- One section should identify what the report does not fully answer yet.
- One section should translate the report into a decision framework for readers.
- Final section: naturally invite readers to join the community or read the full report using this CTA: Join the community to read the full report and review the original charts.
- End with: `*This article is for learning and discussion only and does not constitute investment advice.*`

Content boundaries:
- Do not mention specific investment bank names such as GS. Use "a global investment bank report" if needed.
- Do not use emoji.
- Do not write like a viral post.
- Do not output your reasoning process.
- Do not generate image Markdown; the system will insert original MinerU images afterward.

EQUITY: TECHNOLOGY

# A 2-3 year transition before industrial AI scales up

OT vendors monetize AI by dragging in legacy DCS upgrades; Inovance uses equipment-fused alternative

On 28 April 2026, we published AI impact on factory automation in which we argued that domestic OT (operational technology) incumbents would likely outrank IT platforms in AI landing, with industrial AI acting as a revenue amplifier in the near term rather than a standalone growth driver. In this note, we provide an update on industrial AI, the AOP/TPT/UCS rollout, and a recent industry survey that reiterates the view that: monetisation remains anchored to the legacy DCS installed base, with the AI-led inflection still gated by a 2-3 year transition-pain period.

## Defining industrial AI and the domestic OT vendors' positioning map

Based on our recent industry survey, China's process-industry AI stack is built on four software pillars — TPT (Time-series Pre-trained Transformer), UCS (Universal Control System), AOP (Autonomous Operating Plant) and OMC (Operation Management & Control System) — layered on open-source foundation models. TPT is purpose-built for industrial time-series data, while UCS rebrands legacy DCS (Distributed Control System) by integrating telco/cloud compute, cutting cabinet space \~90% and cabling >80%. In our view, domestic vendors compete less on model capability than on vertical depth. Inovance (300124 CH, Buy) anchors new energy; SUPCON Technology (688777 CH, Not rated) anchors petrochemicals and chemicals; and Hollysys (unlisted) anchors rail transit and power. We believe each has entrenched its position through accumulated process know-how, not horizontal scale. Inovance's path is notably physical-fusion — servo motors, drives and special-purpose PLCs (programmable logic controllers) bound to equipment, rather than software. In our view, this hardware DNA places Inovance in a different AI tier from software-led process incumbents.

## AI deployment: Inovance's physical fusion vs SUPCON's software bundle

Based on our recent industry survey, AI is landing not as a standalone product but bundled onto the installed base. SUPCON Technology's flagship AOP, paired with TPT and subscription MaaS/RaaS (Models-as-a-Service/Results-as-a-Service), is sold into its petrochemical clients. It disclosed CNY184mn of industrial-AI revenue (12% of total revenue) in 1Q26; according to the industry survey, ≥20% is bundled DCS (distributed control system) hardware. Inovance's AI deployment in practice differs: it is physical-fusion, embedding AI and compute into servo drives, motors and special-purpose PLCs (programmable logic controllers) at new-energy and battery plants, rather than selling process software. In addition, Inovance pairs integrated controller-servo solutions with AI plus real-time force control, feeding humanoid-robot supply chains. In our view, Inovance monetises AI through hardware pull-in, not subscription software.

## The transition pains gating China's automation-AI revenue inflection

Based on our recent industry survey, China's automation market remains anchored to DCS, with AI being a revenue amplifier rather than an independent driver. For example, SUPCON's 2026E revenue recovery is likely to be supported by delayed revenue recognition, not AI, based on the industry survey. We see a 2–3 year transition-pain period, as the binding constraints are structural: MaaS/RaaS subscriptions face domestic-substitution and security resistance from SOE clients, costing some legacy orders. In addition, cross-vendor incompatibility is acute. For example, a Siemens (SIE GR, Not rated) PCS7 biopharma project stalled for over half a year because its Profinet protocol did not bridge to SUPCON's Modbus, with full replacement the only fix. We believe industrial-AI software margins ( $\geq$ 20%) far exceed sub-10% DCS margins, supporting mixed expansion once volumes scale. In our view, subscription stickiness, not one-off projects, is the durable inflection.
