# Automation Pipeline Overview

This document is a high-level overview of the repository's automation system.

## Purpose

The repository automates a document-processing pipeline:

1. Collect PDF inputs from source locations.
2. Extract text, tables, and figures.
3. Generate structured drafts and derivative assets.
4. Package review-ready outputs.
5. Build optional summary, media, and search artifacts.
6. Publish a static index that can call a protected serverless gateway for private files.

## High-Level Flow

```text
PDF sources
  -> extraction service
  -> structured source text and figures
  -> generation service
  -> draft variants and normalized assets
  -> review packages / summaries / media artifacts
  -> optional static index + protected file gateway
```

## Main Workflow Groups

| Group | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Batch processing | Extracts PDF content and creates structured draft folders. |
| Package assembly | Builds operator-friendly archives while excluding raw logs and prompts. |
| Summary rendering | Produces compiled PDF summaries from generated source material. |
| Media rendering | Creates optional audio or video explainers from selected documents. |
| Static index build | Produces a searchable metadata/index artifact for the document portal. |
| Gateway deployment | Deploys the serverless API that validates access and serves private files. |
| Alerting | Sends signed server-to-server operational notices through enabled providers. |
| Cleanup | Prunes generated date folders and large transient outputs. |

## Data Boundaries

- Raw PDF inputs are treated as private working material.
- Static index artifacts should contain only metadata and approved search text.
- Private binaries are served through the gateway, not as direct public URLs.
- Heavy generated outputs are transient unless a workflow explicitly commits them.
- Logs, prompts, raw extraction archives, and provider responses should stay out of review packages.

## Output Categories

| Category | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Source extraction | Parsed text, figures, page metadata, extraction status. |
| Draft folders | Generated drafts, normalized figures, status summaries. |
| Review packages | Curated files prepared for operator review. |
| Summaries | Compiled overview documents and supporting figure assets. |
| Media | Optional rendered audio/video assets. |
| Portal data | Catalogs, search indexes, account rules, and static assets. |
| Operational alerts | Signed, deduplicated notifications for workflow failures. |

## Operational Alert Policy

GitHub Actions keeps the original success or failure conclusion for observability and
recovery logic. The separate operator email is quieter: before sending, the shared
alert workflow reads the same workflow's recent run history. A successful run in the
24 hours preceding the failed attempt suppresses the email. Reruns use the current
attempt's actual start time instead of the original run creation time. An email is
sent only when that health window contains no success. The server-side dedupe key is
stable per workflow, so an ongoing outage produces at most one operations email in
each rolling 24-hour period.

If GitHub run history cannot be read, the email is suppressed instead of guessing.
This policy changes notification volume only; failed runs remain visible in GitHub,
private checkpoints and handoffs retain their existing recovery behavior, and no
workflow output is marked successful merely to silence an alert.

The optional chart-search stage and its resumable object-storage checkpoint are
documented in [Chart Search Architecture](chart-search-architecture.md).
The registered-user metadata RAG and private Course-directory recommender are
documented in [Report Chat and Course Recommendation RAG](report-chat-rag-architecture.md).

## Market Views Figure Contract

The private report handoff deliberately excludes each report's `mineru_raw/`
directory. The batch parser therefore retains only its chart-like MinerU
selections as `assets/source_image_<n>.*`. The Market Views builder consumes the
original Markdown-relative image when it is available and falls back to these
stable selected copies when running from the private handoff. Images are
content-hash deduplicated and copied into the transient summary `figures/`
directory; raw source paths never enter the PDF caption.

The ReportLab renderer records count-only/opaque-ID render statistics and fails
instead of silently publishing when a selected figure cannot be inserted. The
workflow also fails if retained MinerU source images exist but zero figure
candidates are produced. The public-copy step removes only the dedicated final
private page and preserves figure image objects on all body pages.

## Explicitly Retained Public Outputs

Heavy outputs remain transient by default. The daily Market Views PDF is the
documented exception: after public-identity validation, its workflow force-adds
only `market_view_summaries/<YYMMDD>/market_views_<YYMMDD>.pdf` to `main`.
Source PDFs, extracted working folders, prompts, and private handoff objects are
not committed. The same validated PDF may also be copied to private object
storage for the website's member download path.

Blog archive shards are another intentional small public output. Their
sanitization, fingerprinting, concurrent-write handling, and edge publishing
contract are documented in [Blog SEO and WeChat Output Contract](blog-seo-wechat-output.md).

## Compatibility Note

Some paths, scripts, prompts, workflows, and environment variables still use historical names. Renaming them would require a migration across GitHub Actions, scripts, generated folders, and downstream references, so this documentation cleanup leaves runtime names intact.
